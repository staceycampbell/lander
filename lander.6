lander \- the arcade game
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lander
is an implementation of the ancient ``lunar lander'' arcade
game.

The object of the game is to gently land a lunar module on
the lunar surface.  Landing with a vertical velocity greater
than 5 metres per second will generally result in fragmentation of the
lander and loss of cabin pressure!
.PP
Scoring is based on which landing pad you choose, how much
fuel you conserved during landing and the difficulty factor
of landing from higher entry velocities as the game progresses.
.PP
Operating instructions are provided on the initial screen of
.I lander.
A high score file is maintained.
