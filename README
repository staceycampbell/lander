This is a C implementation of the old ``lunar lander''
game seen in amusement arcades in the mid-seventies.

This version has been ported to various System 5.3
systems, namely 386/ix and HCR's port of System 5.3 to
a VAX.  It has also been ported to a version of BSD.

Lander utilises some of the nifty SysV.3 curses capabilities
such as line drawing.  Anyone using an ANSI compatible
terminal should see the full effect.  Assorted Visual
terminals will give the same results with a decent terminfo
file.  BSD people are stuck with their implementation
of curses, but it still looks kind of okay.

Lander uses a high score file that is writable by
all users running the program, please edit the Makefile to
ensure a valid name is used.  Lander will attempt to
create the HS file the first time the game is run and
a successful landing is completed.

Please read the copyright info at the bottom of the man page.
